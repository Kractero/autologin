# container assistant
Generate a login sheet, that along with the two userscripts, lets you log into containers fast.

Run login.py with a puppets.txt file with only nation names each on separate lines, it will generate an html sheet ready for logging into containers. Install both userscripts

With autolog.user.js, you need to change the value of enpass.value to the one your puppets have.

Caveats: only works if all your puppets hae the same password
